This is a simple calendar app, created as a coding exercise.


Spec:

* Input events via the array of events in calendar#index

* Each event may overlap at most one other event

* Accommodates start and end times between 11:30pm and 1:30pm

* Multi-day events not supported - must be input as separate events on each day


Other info:

* Ruby 2.2.3
* No added gems
* No automated testing
